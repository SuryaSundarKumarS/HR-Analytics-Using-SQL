# HR-Analytics-Using-SQL
## SQL Data Analysis Project - HR Analytics

In this data analysis project, I leveraged MySQL to conduct a comprehensive analysis of HR analytics data, focusing on employee attrition and its contributing factors. By applying advanced SQL queries and calculations, I extracted valuable insights to assist HR managers in making data-driven decisions to improve workforce management and retention strategies.

Key Highlights:
- Explored employees' age groups to determine their distribution within the organization. The majority of employees fell in the age group of 26-35, constituting 
  41.46% of the workforce.
- Investigated attrition rates to reveal that 16.16% of employees left the company.
- Analyzed attrition patterns based on age groups, highlighting the age group of 26-35 as the most affected, with 7.8% of employees leaving.
- Examined travel frequency based on age groups, uncovering that employees in the age group of 26-35 traveled rarely at 4.78%.
- Evaluated the relationship between job level and attrition, finding that employees in job level 1 (36.54%) and job level 2 (36.68%) had the highest attrition rates.
- Explored the correlation between salary slabs and attrition, with employees earning up to 5k and 5k - 10k having higher attrition rates at 11.10% and 3.37%, respectively.

**Moreover, I presented the data insights in a clear and organized manner, allowing HR professionals to identify critical areas for improvement and implement targeted strategies to reduce attrition. The project showcases my proficiency in SQL data analysis and my ability to provide actionable recommendations to address HR challenges effectively.**

**Through this HR analytics project, I have demonstrated my data analysis skills, empowering organizations with data-backed insights to enhance employee engagement and retention, ultimately contributing to the success of the HR team and the overall growth of the company.**
